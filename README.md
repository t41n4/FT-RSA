### **Summary: RSA Data Transmission Simulation Project**

In this personal project, I developed a simulation of data transmission using the **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** public-key cryptosystem. The goal was to demonstrate how RSA facilitates secure communication by encrypting and decrypting data using a pair of public and private keys. 

The project includes several key stages:

1. **Key Generation**: I implemented the RSA key generation process, where two large prime numbers are selected, and a public key and private key are generated based on these primes. The public key is used to encrypt messages, and the private key is used to decrypt them.

2. **Encryption**: The encryption process simulates how a sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt a message, ensuring that only the recipient, with the corresponding private key, can decrypt and read the message.

3. **Decryption**: The decryption process is performed using the private key, which decrypts the ciphertext back into the original plaintext, demonstrating the secure data transmission aspect of RSA.

4. **Digital Signatures**: I also implemented the process of using RSA to digitally sign messages, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the data being transmitted.

By running various tests on encrypted data, the project effectively simulates the secure transmission of information and demonstrates the underlying mathematical principles of RSA, such as modular arithmetic and prime factorization, while reinforcing how modern systems like HTTPS rely on similar encryption techniques for online security.
